foodli is a recipe search/grocery list app for busy individuals who have to manage/plan the food and meals for their household.


I used javascript for the bulk of my code, with some AJAX for delete/posting functionalities with the My Recipes and My Shopping List pages. I also used some sequelize calls to the database to filter the data for the My Shopping List.
